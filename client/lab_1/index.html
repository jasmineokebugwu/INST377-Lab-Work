<h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2>

<p> <em>  Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text. </em> </p>

<p> <strong> Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text. </strong> </p>

<p> <strong> <em> Sometimes you want to do both. </em> </strong> </p>

<h2> Elements </h2> 

<p> Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. </p>
<p> Neither can image tags, or hard lines. </p> 
<p> Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.  </p>

<p> Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility. </p>
