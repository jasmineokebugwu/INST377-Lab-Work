<h1> Jasmine Okebugwu Lab 1: Intro to HTML </h1>
<h2> First, the basics. </h2>

<p> You need the following to build your website. </p>

<ul>  
    <li> HTML and CSS </li>
    <li> Javascript </li>
    <li> Node.js </li>
    <li> And other web development frameworks </li> 
</ul>

<p> You should list your top 3 goals for the class below. </p>

<ol>
    <li> Learn front-end web design </li>
    <li> Learn new programming languages </li>
    <li> Learn how to work with others in a technical space </li>
    <li> Learn popular web dev frameworks </li>
</ol>

<h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2>

<em>  Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text. </em> 

<strong> Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text. </strong> 

<strong> <em> Sometimes you want to do both. </em></strong>

Empty Elements

<p> Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample. </p>

<p> Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility. </p>
